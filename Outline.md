# Potential outline

- Introduction
  - what are gene catalogs
  - how are they constructed
  - what are representatives
  - similarity vs overlap
- Problems
  - artifact Transistive clustering error (what, how, why)
  - sequence lengths
  - iterative clustering (effects on identity/similarity to rep)
- Improvements
  - bullet points in discussion
  - paper: almeida et al
    - only one clustering round
    - protein level clustering
    - multiple thresholds
    - incomplete control of clustered seqs
